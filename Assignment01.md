# Assigment 1

Due: 19 September 2017

Please make sure your homework has your name (both Chinese and pinyin). You are free to work with others in the class, but everyone should hand in their own assignment. You can submit your assignment either as a PDF document, or as a Jupyter notebook.

0) **Download and read the [Week 1 Notes](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/~peng/teaching/galaxies17/Lecture01-2017.pdf).** This covers the basics of galaxies and some language of astrophysics. If you are new to astronomy, please pay close attention to the terminology, as we will use it often. For those of you who are not familiar with magnitudes, colors, filters, etc., I highly encourage you to look at the [SDSS exercise on color and light](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr12/en/proj/advanced/color/colorhome.aspx).

1) **Install scientific Python.** If you don't already have Python (and associated scientific libraries) installed on your computer, do it! Whether you choose Python 2.7 or >3.3 is up to you, but I recommend Python 3.x if you are new to Python.
You can try the instructions at [Python4Astronomers/Installing Scientific Python](https://python4astronomers.github.io/installation/python_install.html), or many other places online. 

2) **Become familiar with scientific Python.** Look at the [Python4Astronomers/Quick Tour](https://python4astronomers.github.io/intro/quick-tour.html). a) Do [Read a Table and Plotting](https://python4astronomers.github.io/intro/quick-tour.html#reading-a-table-and-plotting), b) [Curve Fitting with Scipy](https://python4astronomers.github.io/intro/quick-tour.html#curve-fitting-with-scipy), and c) [Synthetic Images](https://python4astronomers.github.io/intro/quick-tour.html#synthetic-images). Please save these plots as png or PDF. 

For basic learning, you can check out [Google's Python Introduction](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction), as well as many other resources online. 

3) **Manipulating galaxy images.** [The Sloan Digital Sky Survey](http://www.sdss3.org) is the largest public, homogeneous, digital sky survey. Using the [SDSS Science Archive Server](http://dr12.sdss3.org/), go to the Imaging->Single Fields and search for the galaxy M101. Download the u-band, g-band, and r-band FITS images (links below the color image). Use these images to make a color image following the instructions from the Python4Astronomers Quick Tour, [Make a Publication Quality Image](https://python4astronomers.github.io/intro/quick-tour.html#making-a-publication-quality-image). Save your color image. Does your color image look different from the one that SDSS produced? What are the wavelength ranges sampled by the u, g, and r bands? Think about what it means to make a color image. This is best submitted as a Jupyter notebook.

4) **Exploring galaxies in the SDSS**. Do the [SDSS Galaxies Exercise](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr12/en/proj/advanced/galaxies/galaxieshome.aspx), Exercises 1-7, Questions 1-10. You may work with others in the class, but please do the initial classification by yourself (Exercise 1) by yourself (and turn in your classifications as part of your homework). In the cases where they say you can use Excel, don't use Excel. Please download the CSV files and make your plots using Python.

This assignment is heavy on technical learning, because you need to acquire the tools (Python, SDSS, FITS, etc.) to do more advanced work later. Even if you have trouble with 1), 2), or 3), please make sure you do most of 4). The whole time you are working on this, please think of things you would like to discuss in class.
