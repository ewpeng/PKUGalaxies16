# Assignment 5

Due: 7 December 2020

One of the goals of this class is for you to be able to understand the relevance of any well-presented colloquium in the field of galaxy evolution. For this assignment, please view the following colloquium given at the Space Telescope Science Institute, and answer in detail the questions below.

[How Do Galaxies Evolve into the Forms They Have Today? Susan Kassin (STScI)](http://www.stsci.edu/contents/events/stsci/2018/november/how-do-galaxies-evolve-into-the-forms-they-have-today)

Please write a summary of the colloquium in the form of a "review paper" on this topic, but based on the colloquium. Please write it in a way so that one of your classmates could read *only your summary* and then be able to explain the colloquium to someone else. This means that you may need to read some background papers and explain things that are not explicitly in the talk itself.

Your summary should, at a minimum, address the following questions. You should include figures in your summary when you feel they help explain concepts.

* What are the galaxy evolution questions that the speaker is trying to answer?
* What methods are used to address these questions (data, techniques, surveys, ...)?
* What is new about these studies that has not been done before?
* What future directions are there to make progress in this field? What will JWST be able to do?

In addition, you will probably want to address some of the following specific issues:

* What are the characteristics of the surveys being used (e.g., CANDELS) that make them unique or useful?
* WHat is the significance of using the Tully-Fisher relation?
* What is the sigificance of V/sigma?
* What have they learned about the quenching of galaxies?
